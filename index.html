        <p>Happy Mother’s Day, Ma.
            I may not say it often enough, but please know how deeply grateful I am for everything you do.
            Your love, strength, and unwavering support mean the world to me. </p>
        </p>
            Thank you for always being there, not just as a mother, but as my guide and my home.
            I’m truly blessed to have you.</p>
